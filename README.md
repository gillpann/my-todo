# Todo App

This is a Todo application built with Next.js, Prisma, and MongoDB. It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, with MongoDB Atlas used for database storage.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Setup Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

DATABASE_URL="your-mongodb-connection-url"

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (>= 16.x.x)
MongoDB (or a MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas)
Prisma CLI (if using Prisma)
